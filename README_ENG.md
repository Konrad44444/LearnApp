## Learning
One word is randomly picked from the set, then the description you added is displayed and you have to type in the definition.
If you're right you'll see the green border or the red one if you're wrong. You can also get a hint (first letter od the word) if you haven't typed anything yet. You can also see the amount of words remaining.
